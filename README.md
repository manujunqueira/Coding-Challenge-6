# Coding-Challenge-6
This is the assignment number 6 for ISM3232 Thursdays class

I will create a simple employee shift management system for a small business. The system will track employee shift schedules, check availability, assign shifts, and calculate total hours worked for each employee. We'll use objects to represent employees and shifts, arrays to store multiple employees and shift schedules, and array/object methods to manipulate the data.
